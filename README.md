Ava CMS is a modern flat-file CMS for people who want a website they can **understand**, **move**, **scale** and **keep**.

Your content lives on disk as plain files, not rows in a database or records in a proprietary system. Create a Markdown file and you have a page. Edit it, refresh your browser, and it’s live.

Your site stays readable, portable, and fully yours. No proprietary formats. No hidden layers. Just files in, website out.

```

Ava CMS is not a “one-click” CMS, and it doesn’t try to be. It trades heavy admin interfaces and complex deployment pipelines for speed, clarity, and control. If you’re comfortable editing files, writing a little HTML, and checking documentation — or want a CMS that grows with you as you learn — Ava fits naturally into your workflow.

## ✨ Why Ava CMS?

- 📝 **Markdown & HTML** — Write fast in Markdown, drop into HTML when you need total control.
- ⚡ **Instant feedback** — No complicated build steps or deploy queue. Edit a file, refresh, done with automatic indexing.
- 🎨 **Design freedom** — Plain PHP templates with standard HTML/CSS. Ava CMS stays out of your way.
- 🧩 **Flexible content modeling** — Define blogs, portfolios, events, catalogs, or anything else using custom content types and fields.
- 🚀 **Dynamic features without bloat** — Search, filtering, pagination and sorting work out of the box.
- 🛠️ **Power when you want it** — A CLI, plugin system, and hooks keep put advanced features at hand.
- 📈 **Seamless scaling** — Switch engines with a single setting, optional SQLite keeps sites with tens of thousands of posts snappy. 
- 🤖 **LLM-friendly** — Clear files, detailed docs, and a smooth CLI make Ava CMS + AI tools a great pair to help you build themes and plugins.

## 📦 What’s included

- **Content types**, **custom fields** and **taxonomies** for modeling your site your way
- **Optional admin dashboard** for structured content editing and site monitoring
- **Smart routing** based on your content structure or configured patterns
- **Shortcodes** and **snippets** for reusable dynamic blocks inside Markdown
- **Search** across your content with configurable weighting
- **Plugins + hooks** (with bundled plugins like sitemap, redirects, and feeds)
- **CLI tool** for everyday tasks (cache, users, diagnostics, and more)
- **SEO features** like customisable meta tags, sitemaps, and clean URLs
- **Caching** (two-tier content indexing + configurable full-page caching for static-speed delivery)

## 💡 How it works

1. **Write** — Create Markdown files in `content/`.
2. **Index** — Ava CMS automatically scans your files and builds fast indexes.
3. **Render** — Your theme turns that content into HTML.

You choose how you work: edit directly on your server (SFTP/SSH), work locally and upload, use Git, or mix and match. Ava CMS doesn’t lock you into a workflow, it adapts to yours.

## 🏁 Quick Start

### Requirements

- **PHP 8.3+**
- **Composer**

**Optionally**, for better performance and features:

- **`igbinary`** PHP extension for faster indexing and caching
- **`gd`** or **`imagick`** PHP extension for image processing

**Only faster for massive sites** (~10,000+ items) or **very low memory** environments:

- **`pdo_sqlite`** PHP extension ([see benchmarks](https://ava.addy.zone/docs/performance))

That’s it! Ava CMS is designed to run happily whether it's on modest shared hosting, a scalable VPS, powerful cloud infrastructure or just your local machine and works well with most web servers (Apache, Nginx, Caddy, etc).

### 1) Install

> ⚠️ **Always install from an official release.** Do not clone the repository directly—the main branch may contain incomplete or unstable work-in-progress code.

**Option A: Download a release**

- Download the latest release: https://github.com/avacms/ava/releases
- Extract it into a folder on your machine or server
- Point your **public** root to /public

**Option B: GitHub CLI (`gh`)**

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/ava-release && cd /tmp/ava-release
gh release download -R avacms/ava --pattern '*.zip' --clobber
unzip -q ./*.zip -d /path/to/your/site
cd /path/to/your/site
composer install
```
- Point your **public** root to /public

### 2) Configure

Edit your site settings in `app/config/ava.php`.

### 3) Run locally

Start the built-in PHP development server if you want to run Ava CMS locally:

```bash
./ava start
# or
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4) Create content

Add a new page by creating a Markdown file in `content/pages/`.

**File:** `content/pages/hello-world.md`

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
status: published
---

# Welcome to Ava CMS!

This is my first page. It's just a text file.
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/hello-world` to see it live.

## 🔌 Plugins & Themes

Ava CMS includes a simple hook-based plugin system, and theming is just PHP templates. A few plugins are bundled in this repo (like sitemap, redirects, and a feed plugin) so you can see the pattern and ship common features quickly.

## ⚡ Performance

Ava CMS is designed to be blazing fast, whether you have 100 pages or 100,000:

- **Tiered caching**: avoid repeating expensive work on every request.
- **Page caching** (optional): serve cached HTML to bypass PHP for most visitors.
- **Switchable engines**: use the default binaries for best performance on most sites or seamlessly switch to SQLite for massive sites or low-memory environments.
