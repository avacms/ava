## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Create Your First Page

Add a new file at `content/pages/contact.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Contact
slug: contact
status: published
---

# Get in Touch

Drop us a line at hello@example.com
```

Save it and visit `/contact`. That's all it takes!

### 2. Write a Blog Post

Create `content/posts/my-first-post.md`:

```markdown
---
title: My First Post
slug: my-first-post
date: 2025-01-01
status: published
---

# Hello World

This is my first blog post with Ava.
```

Your post will appear at `/blog/my-first-post`.

> **Tip:** Use the CLI for faster content creation: `./ava make post "My First Post"`

### 3. Customize Your Theme

Templates live in `themes/default/templates/`. They're just PHP with a powerful helper:

```php
<article>
    <h1><?= $ava->e($content->title()) ?></h1>
    <?= $ava->body($content) ?>
</article>
```

Check out the theme files—they're fully commented to help you learn!
