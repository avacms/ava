# Showcase

Ava is still pretty new, but I’d love to build up a little gallery of what people are making.

If you’ve built something with Ava (or you’re working on it), you can share it by:

- Opening an issue: https://github.com/adamgreenough/ava/issues
- Posting in Discord: https://discord.gg/Z7bF9YeK

## Community Websites

Coming soon.

If you have a site you’d like listed here, send a link (plus a short description) via an issue or Discord.

## Themes

Coming soon.

If you’ve made a theme you’re happy to share, tell us where it lives (GitHub repo or zip) and include a screenshot if possible.

## Plugins

Coming soon.

If you’ve written a plugin, share what it does, how to install it, and which Ava version you tested it with.
